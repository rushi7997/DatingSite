# DatingSite
 This is a solo project by me only using PHP.
 so the challenge was to use PHP as much as I Can just to make Tinder Clone.
 
 
 And another challenge was to have it all ready and working just in a week so all of this work has been done by me in a week.

### Features

- Home Page :
    - You will have 3 buttons Login, Signup and Profiles
    - Profiles button shows you top five profiles of the application
    that means 5 of the most winked profile.
    
- Login Page
this is the page that you can access only when you are logged in and once you get into the page you will get 3 different components 

 - 1 ) Profile (in which logged in profile details are there)
 - 2 ) other Profiles to choose from (in which if logged in profile is male then he will get all the female profile to choose from and if the profile is female than she will get all the male profile to choose from)
 - 3 ) Wink Read tab (in which you will know if someone has winked you or not).
 - 4 ) Matched Tab in this tab you will know if some one winked back at you or not so if both guys winked at each other that will form an match. and a successfull match can start a conversasion :)
 
 - Message page:
  - onclicking any of the matched profiles you will get to the message him/ mer page where you can chat. in this page you will have to reload in order to load the message **I Suggest that you restart the page**
